-- must be done before release --

- **Need to validate input data structures**

-- may be done later --

- Better exception handling for rooms. For example, throwing an exception in host.saveWorld throws an exception and causes the room to be lost as a zombie
- Ways to cure zombie worlds (basically, we must assume that it is always possible for a world to become a zombie - so we need some way to stop/restart worlds that become zombies)
- Make FastEndpoints for websockets not emit an error message on closing (should probably switch to MVC controller)
- Resolve TODOs
- In addition to logging, make sure to retrieve profiling metrics for live health information
- Hook up server to prometheus
- The logs for every EFCore SQL queries is annoying, can we get rid of them?
