# logging/profiling

- Resolve TODO(logging)s
- Hook up server to prometheus
- In addition to logging, make sure to retrieve profiling metrics for live health information
- Insert tons of profiling code and hook it up to Prometheus (need to see how well the SFG server performs)

- The logs for every EFCore SQL queries is annoying, can we get rid of them?
- Make FastEndpoints for websockets not emit an error message on closing (should probably switch to MVC controller)

# more robust

- Better exception handling for rooms.
  For example, throwing an exception in host.saveWorld throws an exception and causes the room to be lost as a zombie

- Ways to cure zombie worlds
  (basically, we must assume that it is always possible for a world to become a zombie,
  so we need some way to stop/restart worlds that become zombies)

# api niceness

- Generate API code from Swagger, and include it directly in to the SFG Client API rather than duplicating the API endpoints

# misc things (i am abusing this file to note down things that need to be done in the client too):

- Support changing world name
- Generate world data for registered accounts
- Capatcha to prevent duplicate accounts
- Remove random 2nd player in upper left
- API errors need to be friendlier (not just "undefined")
