  /*
how we arrived at this function was a lot of math, but to go straight from point A to point B
i sampled N1KF's physics simulation at a bunch of points (my spin https://jsfiddle.net/oy85h1rm/1/)
i sampled 3000 ticks and their positions, and noticed that it was constantly changing up until 1500 ticks.
to approximate it fast, i had to cut the approximation at some point

then i played in EE, and after about 3 seconds (300 ticks) the acceleration didn't feel like it was increasing
that much, so i decided i'd cut the amount of ticks i'd simulate at that point.

now that i had this, i took an equation from luke that looked something like p'' = a - r * p'
where `p(x)` would be the function below, and `a` and `r` would be the drag and resistance,
magic doo daa magic dee daa solved for `a` and `r`, and those are our magic constants

you can actually find this exact same formula in EEU too. what this function does is described in the documentation of this method
