        this update just features a big ol' reskin of the game to try to get it to feel and look a
        bit nicer and more professional so that it's taken more seriously lol. ofc there are still
        areas where it's very rough around the edges but i just haven't gotten to those parts yet
      </p>
      <p>
        in more important news i am going to have a lot less time to work on smiley face game
        starting next week. hopefully things will still move smoothly
